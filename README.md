# RAG Project

This repository contains a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) example.

## Contents
- `cat-facts.txt`: A sample dataset of cat facts.
- `rag_from_scratch.py`: Python script to load the dataset and demonstrate basic RAG operations.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/singh-krishan/rag_from_scratch.git
   cd rag_from_scratch
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python rag_from_scratch.py
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- (Optional) Any dependencies listed in your script or requirements.txt

## Description
This project demonstrates how to load a dataset and prepare it for use in a RAG pipeline. You can extend this example to include embedding models, vector databases, and more advanced retrieval techniques.
